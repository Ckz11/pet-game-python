# pet-game-python

This is my first program in Python. It's a game played in the console.

## Remember Tomogachis and Digivices?

Well, this is similar to that. Train, play, feed, and care for your little digital friend. Let them grow stronger and possibly even change forms!

## Project Log

- What's Done
  - you can name your pet, and Feed, Train, Play, Clean, and put your pet to sleep
