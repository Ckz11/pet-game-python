# digimon-python-game

This is my first program in Python. It's a game played in the console.

## Remember Tomogachi's?

Well, this is similar to that. Train, play, feed, and care for your little digital friend. Let them grow stronger and possibly even change forms!

## Project Log

- What's Done
  - you can name your Digimon, and Feed, Train, Play, Clean, and put your digimon to sleep
  - Random chance of digimon pooping
  - Check your digimon's current stats
- Upcoming features
  - Digimon can digivolve to rookie, champion, ultimate, and mega forms
  - Stat upgrades when digivolving
  - Possible "adventure" mode
    - Battle other digimon in game
      - It will just say something like "You fought a biyomon, you won!" or "You fought a sakuyamon, you lost!"
